## About Me

Hi!

My name is Roland Csaszar (pronouns: he/him).

Some random facts about me and opinions of mine to give you a first impression, if that's why you are here for:

- I'm getting paid as a Linux C and C++ developer for almost 20 years now.
- At the job, apart from C(++), I do use TypeScript and Go for "web stuff" and Python and Shell for "scripting stuff". Maintaining -- and before that, creating -- the Ubuntu based Linux distribution some of our teams use is also an important part of my work.
- Learning, using and doing new stuff I **really** do like, not just coding related, but in general. That's why most of the projects exist at all, even if some are just tools my wife or I needed. That's also why you won't see much C and almost no C++ in my projects.
- The software I use and build shall be free or open-source software, if possible.
- In my opinion, FOSS shall run on e.g. Windows and MacOS too, not just on *BSD and Linux, if that makes sense. That's at least what I always try to do, and why I try to avoid using platform specific functions, libraries or languages. Supporting iOS is a problem for me though, because of the need to join Apple's Developer Program.
- I like writing Haskell and Go programs, obviously for different reasons. Both enable to write different kinds of "elegant" code, but with the temptation to over-abstract code in Haskell. I've grown to prefer "straightforward" solutions to general ones, if possible - I did already say that I've been maintaining C++ programs for a long time, did I? And the tooling for Go - especially the LSP and the integration in VS Code - is just great and works reliably and performant even in bigger code bases like the Go compiler (I'm currently writing a compiler for my own language in Go, but it'll take some time until that will appear here if at all).
- A great part of the programs and libraries are written in TypeScript (JavaScript) or Python. Because JavaScript and TypeScript are nice languages I like to use and because of Python's standard library. I generally realized I **really** do prefer languages with a big, usable standard library -- another reason why I began to use Go.
- Other languages that did interest me enough to try them: I've also written code (or proofs) in Rust, Fortran, Idris 2 and Rocq (which had been called Coq) and dabbled a bit in [Clojure](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/Clojure-Template), Racket, [Common Lisp](https://release-candidate.github.io/Lisbonacci/), Unison and Chapel 2.
- As an Emacs user of more than 20 years I made the switch to VS Code some time in fall of 2021.<br>
*How is that in line with being a proponent of "free as in speech"?*
Yes, it's complicated...
- I do use (neo)vi(m) on remote hosts via SSH. And despite using it for decades now, I still never use anything but the most basic commands and key bindings. Why is there a vi mode for Emacs (and just about any text editor) but no non-modal mode with sane key-bindings for (neo)vi(m)? ðŸ˜ˆ ðŸ§Œ *Oh, look, a Gen Xer using emojis!ðŸ™„*

Anyways, if you want to see what I've spent my spare time on when programming and doing something else than what's my (usual) job, see below. Projects are publicly available only if I think other people could use them. So I did not add stuff like for example using Rocq (formerly known as Coq) with [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), going through [Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris) with Idris 2 and similar. But I **do** recommend you take a at least look at these two, even if the result of doing the Idris examples is just to get some arguments why adding dependent types to GHC is actually a bad idea.
There are also no projects online which are too early in development or my be never finished (like a compiler for my own programming language or a build system in Python). Whereas my dabbling with [Flix](#flix-programming-language-projects-flix) and [WASM GC](#wasm-web-assembly-gc-project-wasm) is included, because there isn't much code written in Flix or WASM GC available at all.

## Projects

All open source projects are hosted on [https://github.com/Release-Candidate/](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/).
I also use a GitLab account, which is mainly used to file bug reports and make merge requests: [https://gitlab.com/ReleaseCandidate](https://gitlab.com/ReleaseCandidate).

The list of my "most important" (whatever that means) open source projects, roughly in order of number of users is below. Smaller stuff that isn't being mentioned below can by found at [GitHub - List of my Repositories](https://github.com/Release-Candidate?tab=repositories).

### VS Code and VSCodium Extensions (TypeScript)

#### Chez Scheme REPL

An extension for Chez Scheme, it uses the REPL for auto-completions and to evaluate expressions. The extension does syntax highlighting, shows the documentation on hover, provides auto-completion, marks errors and multiple ways to interact with the Chez Scheme REPL.

- [Chez Scheme REPL GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/vscode-scheme-repl)
- [Chez Scheme REPL - Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Release-Candidate/vscode-scheme-repl)

### Program To Convert A Directory Of Obsidian Notes To Org-Mode Notes (Python)

Obs2Org is a cross platform command (works on *BSD, Linux, OS X and Windows) line program to convert Obsidian style Markdown files to Org-Mode files for Emacs and other Editors that support Org-Mode.

It converts the Markdown files using Pandoc and afterwards corrects the links to headings in other Org-Mode files, converts the hash-tag style Obsidian tags to Org-Mode style tags and puts angle brackets around dates.

- [Obs2Org GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/Obs2Org)

### Buck 2 Build System (Starlark, Python)

The Python script named `dromedary.py` (in analogy to [Reindeer](https://github.com/facebookincubator/reindeer), which enables using Cargo packages in Rust Buck 2 projects), that I made for Meta, which helps using OCaml packages with Buck 2.

- [ocaml-scripts by Meta, GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/ocaml-scripts)

Example OCaml project on how to use the above Buck 2 integration of Opam (the OCaml package manager) and build OCaml using Buck 2:

- [OCaml Buck2 Examples GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/OCaml-Buck-2-Examples)

Two example projects on how to use Buck 2 to build and test C++, using VCPKG or Conan as package manager:

- [C++ Buck2 Vcpkg Examples GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/Cxx-Buck2-vcpkg-Examples)
- [C++ Buck2 Conan Examples GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/Cxx-Buck2-Conan-Examples)

### Python Converter for Maya Tzolkâ€™in Dates (Python)

This converts mayan Tzolkâ€™in dates to Gregorian dates and vice versa:

- [tzolkin-calendar GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/tzolkin-calendar)
- [tzolkin-calendar - PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tzolkin-calendar/)

- [go-gap-buffer - pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Release-Candidate/go-gap-buffer)

### Performance Optimizations (Go, Haskell, C)

This has been my go [*Oh, what a pun!*] at [The One Billion Row Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc?tab=readme-ov-file#rules-and-limits). There you can see the step-by-step iterations I used to optimize a Go program from taking 100s to 3.2s for the parsing of 1 billion rows of data. And Haskell and C versions of the same program too.

- [1 Billion Row Challenge GitHub](https://github.com/Release-Candidate/1-billion-row-challenge)

### PWAs (SolidJS, Typescript)
